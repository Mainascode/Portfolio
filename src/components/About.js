      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
       I'm a full-stack web developer with a sharp focus on JavaScript and Python. As a freelancer, I bring speed, clarity, and deep problem-solving to every project — from front-end interfaces to back-end architecture. I don’t just write code. I think through the problem, move fast on solutions, and bring passion to the process. Whether it's building from scratch or fixing what others can't, I get things done — clean, efficient, and ready to scale.
